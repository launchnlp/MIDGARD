step 0: Init
step 1: Energy is stored in a battery.
step 2: The energy is released from the battery as electrical current.
step 3: The electrical current goes to a motor.
step 4: The motor makes the needle of the sewing machine go up and down.
step 5: The needle is pressed through the piece of clothing at a constant rate.
step 6: Thread is attached and used to stitch the clothing.

List of participants:
participant 0: electrical current
participant 1: energy

step 0: Init
step 1: Warm air rises.
step 2: Then it expandes and cools.
step 3: Some of the vapor condenses onto tiny pieces of dust that are floating in the air.
step 4: Forms a tiny droplet around each dust particle.
step 5: Billions of these droplets come together they become a visible cloud.
