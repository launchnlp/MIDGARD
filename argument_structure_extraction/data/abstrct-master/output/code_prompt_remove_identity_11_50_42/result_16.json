    "input": "Few controlled clinical trials exist to support oral combination therapy in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Patients with PAH (idiopathic [IPAH] or associated with connective tissue disease [APAH-CTD]) taking bosentan (62.5 or 125 mg twice daily at a stable dose for \u22653 months) were randomized (1:1) to sildenafil (20 mg, 3 times daily; n = 50) or placebo (n = 53). The primary endpoint was change from baseline in 6-min walk distance (6MWD) at week 12, assessed using analysis of covariance. Patients could continue in a 52-week extension study. An analysis of covariance main-effects model was used, which included categorical terms for treatment, baseline 6MWD (<325 m; \u2265325 m), and baseline aetiology; sensitivity analyses were subsequently performed. In sildenafil versus placebo arms, week-12 6MWD increases were similar (least squares mean difference [sildenafil-placebo], -2.4 m [90% CI: -21.8 to 17.1 m]; P = 0.6); mean \u00b1 SD changes from baseline were 26.4 \u00b1 45.7 versus 11.8 \u00b1 57.4 m, respectively, in IPAH (65% of population) and -18.3 \u00b1 82.0 versus 17.5 \u00b1 59.1 m in APAH-CTD (35% of population). One-year survival was 96%; patients maintained modest 6MWD improvements. Changes in WHO functional class and Borg dyspnoea score and incidence of clinical worsening did not differ. Headache, diarrhoea, and flushing were more common with sildenafil. Sildenafil, in addition to stable (\u22653 months) bosentan therapy, had no benefit over placebo for 12-week change from baseline in 6MWD. The influence of PAH aetiology warrants future study.\n",
