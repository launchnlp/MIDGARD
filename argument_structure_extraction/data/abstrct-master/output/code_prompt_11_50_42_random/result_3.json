D.) in the timolol and -4.0 +/- 2.0 mmHg in the brimonidine group (p = 0.0138). The 95% confidence interval of the inter-group difference was greater than the pre-determined criterion of non-inferiority of brimonidine to timolol. When added to PG analogues, the IOP-lowering effect of brimonidine (-2.9 +/- 1.8 mmHg) was greater than that of the placebo (-2.1 +/- 1.8 mmHg) (p = 0.0010). No appreciable adverse side effects were encountered.\nTopical brimonidine showed an additive IOP-lowering effect to topical PG analogues, although its IOP-lowering effect was inferior to topical timolol as monotherapy.\n",
