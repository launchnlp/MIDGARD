Adult patients with advanced cancer, CACS, weight loss (> or = 5% over 6 months), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) < or = 2 were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to receive CE (standardized for 2.5 mg THC and 1 mg cannabidiol) or THC (2.5 mg) or PL orally, twice daily for 6 weeks. Appetite, mood, and nausea were monitored daily with a visual analog scale (VAS); QOL was assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (composite score: questions 29 and 30). Cannabinoid-related toxicity was assessed every 2 weeks. Of 289 patients screened, 243 were randomly assigned and 164 (CE, 66 of 95 patients; THC, 65 of 100 patients; and PL, 33 of 48 patients) completed treatment. At baseline, groups were comparable for age (mean, 61 years), sex (54% men), weight loss (32% > or = 10%), PS (13% ECOG = 2), antineoplastic treatment (50%), appetite (mean VAS score, 31/100 mm), and QOL (mean score, 30/100). Intent-to-treat analysis showed no significant differences between the three arms for appetite, QOL, or cannabinoid-related toxicity. Increased appetite was reported by 73%, 58%, and 69% of patients receiving CE, THC, or PL, respectively. An independent data review board recommended termination of recruitment because of insufficient differences between study arms. CE at the oral dose administered was well tolerated by these patients with CACS. No differences in patients' appetite or QOL were found either between CE, THC, and PL or between CE and THC at the dosages investigated. "

            "content": " To test the equivalence of three versus four cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) and of the 5-day schedule versus 3 days per cycle in good-prognosis germ cell cancer. The study was designed as a 2 x 2 factorial trial. The aim was to rule out a 5% decrease in the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate. The study included the assessment of patient quality of life. A cycle of BEP consisted of etoposide 500 mg/m(2), administered at either 100 mg/m(2) days 1 through 5 or 165 mg/m(2) days 1 through 3, cisplatin 100 mg/m(2), administered at either 20 mg/m(2) days 1 through 5 or 50 mg/m(2) days 1 and 2. Bleomycin 30 mg was administered on days 1, 8, and 15 during cycles 1 through 3. The randomization procedure allowed some investigators to participate only in the comparison of three versus four cycles. From March 1995 until April 1998, 812 patients were randomly assigned to receive three or four cycles: of these, 681 were also randomly assigned to the 5-day or the 3-day schedule. Histology, marker values, and disease extent are well balanced in the treatment arms of the two comparisons. The projected 2-year PFS is 90.4% on three cycles and 89.4% on four cycles. The difference in PFS between three and four cycles is -1.0% (80% confidence limit [CL], -3.8%, +1.8%). Equivalence for three versus four cycles is claimed because both the upper and lower bounds of the 80% CL are less than 5%. In the 5- versus 3-day comparison, the projected 2-year PFS is 88.8% and 89.7%, respectively (difference, -0.9%, (80% CL, -4.1%, +2.2%). Hence, equivalence is claimed in this comparison also. Frequencies of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were essentially similar. Quality of life was maintained better in patients receiving three cycles; no differences were detected between 3 and 5 days of treatment. We conclude that three cycles of BEP, with etoposide at 500 mg/m(2), is sufficient therapy in good-prognosis germ cell cancer and that the administration of the chemotherapy in 3 days has no detrimental effect on the effectiveness of the BEP regimen.

            "content": " A randomised controlled trial of radiotherapy alone versus radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide for patients with glioblastoma showed that survival was higher for patients assigned combination treatment compared with those assigned standard radiotherapy alone. This paper reports the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the patients in this trial. 573 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma were randomly allocated either radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy and temozolomide. The primary endpoint was survival, and HRQOL was a secondary endpoint. We assessed HRQOL at baseline and at every 3 months during treatment until progression using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire core-30 (QLQ-C30) and the EORTC brain cancer module (EORTC BN-20). We calculated changes from baseline score for seven predefined HRQOL measures (fatigue, overall health, social function, emotional function, future uncertainty, insomnia, and communication deficit) and differences between groups for these measures at every time point. The significance of, and proportions of patients with, improved HRQOL scores--defined as a change of 10 points or more--were recorded. Baseline questionnaires were available for 490 (86%) patients. Baseline HRQOL scores did not differ between groups. At first follow-up, groups differed only in social functioning, favouring the radiotherapy-only group (mean score 79.0 [SD 3.2] for patients assigned radiotherapy vs 67.4 [2.7] for those assigned radiotherapy and temozolomide; difference between groups 11.6 points [95% CI 3.5-19.7], p=0.0052). Over subsequent assessments, HRQOL was much the same between treatment groups. Addition of temozolomide during and after radiotherapy for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma significantly improved survival without a negative effect on HRQOL. "

Quality of life is an important issue in pancreatic cancer patients. A prospective randomized clinical study on the treatment of patients with resectable and unresectable pancreatic cancer was conducted at the Department of Oncology of Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital, and in this study, quality of life was analyzed. The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of combined treatment methods on quality of life in patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. During 2000-2005, two concomitant chemoradiation treatment methods (radiotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and radiotherapy with gemcitabine) were analyzed in the study. A total of 60 patients were enrolled: 41 patients diagnosed with resectable and 19 patients diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Quality of life was assessed using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire. Three main quality of life scales (general health status, functional, and symptom scales) were assessed and compared between two treatment groups. The analysis of quality of live assessment showed a statistically significant decrease in quality of life after treatment in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer and treated with radiotherapy and gemcitabine. Decreased quality of life later after treatment was also observed in patients diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer and treated with the same regimen. Treatment with radiotherapy and 5-fluorouracil changed only some aspects of quality of life and did not have a significant impact on quality of life. "

A total of 80 patients were registered to participate in a randomized, single-blind phase III trial to evaluate the difference in efficacy of \"laying on of hands\" by either a \"healer\" or an actor. Each group consisted of 40 patients, scheduled to receive treatment for 5 min, three times a week. The effect of treatment was measured using a \"Well-Being scale\", with the difference of the average score of the \"Well-Being scale\" on day 10 being defined as primary and that on day 5 as secondary endpoint. There was no significant difference in average score values between the \"healer\" and the actor with regard to the primary (p = 0.34) or the secondary endpoint (p = 0.94), but the comparison was limited due to major protocol violations by the \"healer\" who unblinded his status after the first run and quit the study. The study was completed by the actor as a descriptive, explorative study on the impact of \"laying on of hands\". A significant improvement in symptoms after treatment was found on day 5 (p < 0.001) and on day 10 (p = 0.0002). \"Laying on of hands\" resulted in a significant improvement of cancer- or cancer-therapy-associated symptoms. The magnitude of improvement obtained was similar whether on a self-declared-healer- or an actor-provided \"treatment\". "
