    "input": "The role of gut microbiota in the management of diabetes is shown. In this randomized clinical trial we assessed the effects of synbiotic supplementation on insulin, lipid profile and antioxidative status among women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Ninety pregnant women with GDM were randomly assigned into two groups to receive either a daily synbiotic capsule - consisting of L. acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. gasseri (1.5-7.0\u202f\u00d7\u202f109-10\u202fCFU/g) - with fructooligosaccharide (38.5\u202fmg), or placebo for 6\u202fweeks. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), high- and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C, LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DSP) were assessed before and after the intervention. No significant changes in FPG, insulin resistance/sensitivity, lipid profile and TAC indices were seen in synbiotic group compared to the placebo one (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). Significant within group increases for HDL-C and TAC levels in synbiotic group were observed (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). LDL-C showed significant increment in the placebo group compared to the baseline of the study (6.9\u202fmg/dL, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Between group comparison showed significant decrease in SBP and DBP in synbiotic group compared to placebo (-2.5 vs. 8.6\u202fmmHg, and -1.8 vs. 2.1\u202fmmHg, p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The results showed that, in women with GDM, synbiotic supplementation had no effect on FPG and insulin resistance/sensitivity indices. Lipid profile and TAC status may be affected by synbiotic supplementation. Synbiotic is effective in reducing of blood pressure in women with GDM.\n",
