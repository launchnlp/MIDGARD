    "input": "The purpose of this review is to correlate predictions based on pre-clinical data with outcomes from clinical trials that examine the effects of incretin-based diabetes treatments on the kidney. The incretin-based treatments include agonists of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) and inhibitors of the enzyme, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). In addition, what is known about the incretin-based therapies will be compared to what is known about the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. Large-scale clinical trials have shown that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce albuminuria and preserve estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with diabetic nephropathy. A concise and plausible hemodynamic mechanism is supported by pre-clinical research on the physiology and pharmacology of SGLT2. Large-scale clinical trials have shown that incretin-based therapies mitigate albuminuria but have not shown beneficial effects on eGFR. Research on the incretin-based therapies has yielded a diverse array of direct effects throughout the body, which fuels speculation as to how these drugs might benefit the diabetic kidney and affect its function(s). But in vivo experiments have yet to confirm that the proposed mechanisms underlying emergent phenomena, such as proximal tubular fluid reabsorption, are the ones predicted by cell and molecular experiments. There may be salutary effects of incretin-based treatments on the diabetic kidney, but the system is complex and not amenable to simple explanation or prior prediction. This contrasts with the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, which can be explained concisely.\n",

    "inference": "The purpose of this review is to examine the effects of incretin-based diabetes treatments, including GLP-1R agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors, on the kidney and compare them to the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. While SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce albuminuria and preserve eGFR in patients with diabetic nephropathy, the effects of incretin-based therapies on eGFR have not been as clear. Pre-clinical research on the physiology and pharmacology of SGLT2 supports a concise and plausible hemodynamic mechanism for its renal effects, but the diverse array of direct effects of incretin-based therapies throughout the body makes it difficult to predict their effects on the diabetic kidney. While there may be potential benefits of incretin-based treatments on the diabetic kidney, the complexity of the system makes it difficult to make prior predictions, in contrast to the concise explanation for the renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors.",
