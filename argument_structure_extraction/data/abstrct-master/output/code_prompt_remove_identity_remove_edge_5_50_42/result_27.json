    "input": "\n\nTo compare phacoemulsification versus trabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C in medically uncontrolled chronic angle-closure glaucoma (CACG) without cataract.\nProspective, randomized clinical trial.\nFifty medically uncontrolled CACG eyes without cataract of 50 patients.\nPatients were randomized into undergoing either phacoemulsification or trabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C. After surgery, patients were followed up every 3 months for 2 years.\nIntraocular pressure (IOP) and requirement for glaucoma drugs.\nTwenty-six CACG eyes were randomized to receive phacoemulsification, and 24 eyes underwent trabeculectomy with mitomycin C. Phacoemulsification and trabeculectomy resulted in significant and comparable IOP reduction at 24 months after surgery (reduction of 8.4 mmHg or 34% for phacoemulsification vs 8.9 mmHg or 36% for trabeculectomy; P=0.76). Over first 24 months, trabeculectomy-treated eyes required on average 1.1 fewer drugs than phacoemulsification-treated eyes (P<0.001). However, trabeculectomy was associated with significantly more surgical complications than phacoemulsification (46% vs 4%; P=0.001). Eight (33%) of 24 trabeculectomy eyes demonstrated cataract during follow-up.\nBoth phacoemulsification and trabeculectomy are effective in reducing IOP in medically uncontrolled CACG eyes without cataract. Trabeculectomy is more effective than phacoemulsification in reducing dependence on glaucoma drugs, but is associated with more complications.\n",
