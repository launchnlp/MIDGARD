IOPs were measured at baseline, 2 weeks, and 1, 2, 4, and 6 months. The primary outcome measure was the mean change in IOP from baseline at each visit. Secondary outcome measures included the incidence of adverse events.\nEighty patients (80 eyes) were included finally: 40 eyes in each group. Baseline mean IOPs were 24.78\u00b13.53 and 25.26\u00b13.51 mm Hg for BTFC and TTFC, respectively (P=0.344). Both drops provided statistically significant IOP reductions from baseline at all visits (P<0.001). BTFC provided greater significant mean IOP reductions from baseline than TTFC at each visit (P<0.001). Mean IOP reductions were 11.34 and 6.42 mm Hg at 2 weeks (P=0.000), and 11.17 and 7.89 mmHg at 6 months (P=0.001) for BTFC and TTFC, respectively. IOPs at 2 weeks were 18 mm Hg in 36 (90.8%) versus 22 (55%) eyes and 16 mm Hg in 28 (70%) versus 16 (40%) eyes (P<0.001), and at 6 months, 18 mm Hg in 38 (95%) versus 28 (70%) eyes and 16 mm Hg in 30 (75%) versus 18 (45%) eyes for BTFC and TTFC, respectively (P<0.001).\nBoth drops provided effective IOP reduction that was greater and patients were more likely to achieve lower target pressures with BTFC than with TTFC.\n",
