    "input": "Although anthracyclines are effective chemotherapeutic agents for treating B-cell lymphoma, adverse effects, such as bone marrow suppression and cardiotoxicity, limit their clinical application. We assessed whether anthracycline treatment also increases the risk for diabetes mellitus in patients with B-cell lymphoma. Using data obtained from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database from 2004 to 2011, we compared overall survival and clinical features for B-cell lymphoma patients administered anthracyclines (n\u2009=\u20093147) and those not administered anthracyclines (n\u2009=\u2009837). The impact of anthracycline treatment on diabetes risk was further investigated using a Gray's test and multivariate competing-risk regression models in a dose-dependent manner. Anthracycline administration was associated with a higher incidence of diabetes (HR: 1.75; 95% CI 1.11-2.75; p\u2009=\u20090.0163) after adjustments for age, gender, cumulative dose of prednisolone, and co-morbidities. Cumulative anthracycline doses of 253-400 mg (HR: 2.35; 95% CI 1.41-3.91; p\u2009=\u20090.0010), 401-504 mg (HR: 2.26; 95% CI 1.26-4.05; p\u2009=\u20090.0063), and\u2009>\u2009504 mg (HR: 2.29; 95% CI 1.25-4.18; p\u2009=\u20090.0072) increased the incidence density of diabetes in a dose-dependent manner (p\u2009=\u20090.0006). The annual alteration of adapted diabetes complications severity index score was not significantly different between B-cell lymphoma patients with or without anthracycline treatment (p\u2009=\u20090.4924). Anthracycline therapy increases diabetes risk in a dose-dependent manner in B-cell lymphoma patients. Intensive blood glucose monitoring and control should be recommended for B-cell lymphoma patients receiving anthracycline treatment.\n",
