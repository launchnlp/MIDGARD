    "input": "To evaluate the effects of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on nocturnal and daytime hypoglycemia in persons with type 1 diabetes treated with multiple daily insulin injections (MDI); we also evaluated factors related to differences in hypoglycemia confidence in this population. Evaluations were performed from the GOLD randomized trial, an open-label multicenter crossover randomized clinical trial (n\u2009=\u2009161) over 69 weeks comparing CGM to self-measurement of blood glucose (SMBG) in persons with type 1 diabetes treated with MDI. Masked CGM and the hypoglycemia confidence questionnaire were used for evaluations. Time with nocturnal hypoglycemia, glucose levels <70\u2009mg/dL was reduced by 48% (10.2 vs. 19.6\u2009min each night, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and glucose levels <54\u2009mg/dL by 65%. (3.1 vs. 8.9\u2009min, P\u2009<\u20090.001). For the corresponding glucose cutoffs, daytime hypoglycemia was reduced by 40% (29 vs. 49\u2009min, P\u2009<\u20090.001) and 54% (8 vs. 18\u2009min., P\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively. Compared with SMBG, CGM use improved hypoglycemia-related confidence in social situations (P\u2009=\u20090.016) and confidence in more broadly avoiding serious problems due to hypoglycemia (P\u2009=\u20090.0020). Persons also reported greater confidence in detecting and responding to decreasing blood glucose levels (thereby avoiding hypoglycemia) during CGM use (P\u2009=\u20090.0033) and indicated greater conviction that they could more freely live their lives despite the risk of hypoglycemia (P\u2009=\u20090.022). CGM reduced time in both nocturnal and daytime hypoglycemia in persons with type 1 diabetes treated with MDI and improved hypoglycemia-related confidence, especially in social situations, thus contributing to greater well-being and quality of life.\n",
