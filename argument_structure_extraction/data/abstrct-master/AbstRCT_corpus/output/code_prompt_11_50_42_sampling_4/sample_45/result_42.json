    "input": "Methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2) inhibition has been shown to result in significant weight loss and improved glucose control. This Phase 1 clinical trial assessed the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of a novel MetAP2 inhibitor, ZGN-1061. This clinical trial included a single ascending dose (SAD) phase in healthy subjects (BMI 23 to <30 kg/m2 ) and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase in otherwise healthy subjects with BMI 27 to 40 kg/m2 . SAD phase doses, administered subcutaneously (SC) were 0.2, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 3.6, and 4.8 mg, and MAD phase evaluated 0.2, 0.6, and 1.8 mg twice weekly SC for 4 weeks. SAD phase included 39 subjects (ZGN-1061 N=28, placebo N=11), 90% male and BMI 26.4 kg/m2 . ZGN-1061 was well tolerated across all doses with most frequent adverse events of mild headache and procedural-related irritation. There were no severe or serious adverse events. All doses of ZGN-1061 were rapidly absorbed and cleared, resulting in short duration of exposure that is anticipated to minimize potential off-drug target risks. The MAD phase included 29 subjects (ZGN-1061 N=22, placebo N=7), 76% male and BMI 33.5 kg/m2 . Safety observations were consistent with SAD findings. Efficacy measures in the MAD phase indicated trends for weight change (-1.5 kg total ZGN-1061 vs -0.2 kg placebo) and other biomarker changes. ZGN-1061 was well tolerated with no safety signals in all doses tested. In addition, the desired pharmacokinetic profile and preliminary efficacy observations with ZGN-1061 support evaluation in larger and longer clinical trials.\n",
