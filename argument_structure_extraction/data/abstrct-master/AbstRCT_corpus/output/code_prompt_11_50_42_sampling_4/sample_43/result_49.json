    "input": "Emerging genetic, ex-vivo, and clinical trial evidence indicates that calcium channel blockers (CCB) can improve mood and cognitive function. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy augmented with CCB on depression and cognitive decline in an elderly population with hypertension. Prospective study of 296 persons treated with SSRI and antihypertensive drugs. Baseline and two year clinic assessments were used to categorize participants as users of SSRI + CCB (n = 53) or users of SSRI + other antihypertensives (n = 243). Clinic visits were performed up to four times in a ten-year period to assess depression and cognitive function. The sample mean age was 75.2 \u00b1 5.47 years and 78% of participants were female. At two year follow-up there was a significant group by time interaction showing lower Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CESD) scores in the SSRI + CCB group, F(1,291) = 4.13, p = 0.043, \u03b72 p = 0.014. Over ten-years follow-up, SSRI + CCB use was associated with improved general cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Examination: \u03b2 = 0.97; 95% CI 0.14 to 1.81, p = 0.023) and immediate visual memory (Boston Visual Retention Test: \u03b2 = 0.69; 95% CI 0.06 to 1.32, p = 0.033). The findings provide general population evidence that SSRI augmentation with CCB may improve depression and cognitive function.\n",
