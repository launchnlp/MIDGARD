To evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on \u03b2-cell function and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes. Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA; VA Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH. A total of 127 patients (mean age, 60 years) with stable (HbA1c \u22647.5%) diabetes managed with lifestyle only or lifestyle plus metformin. Subjects were given 4000 units of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) daily or placebo for 48 weeks. Insulin secretion rate (ISR) was estimated from peripheral plasma C-peptide levels after a 3-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance test done at baseline and week 24. Changes in HbA1c were assessed at 16, 24, 36, and 48 weeks. Baseline mean plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration was 26.6 ng/mL, mean HbA1c was 6.6%, and 78% of patients were on metformin. At week 24, mean 25(OH)D changed by 20.5 and -1.6 ng/mL in the vitamin D and placebo groups, respectively (P < 0.001). The vitamin D and placebo groups did not differ in change in ISR or HbA1c. Among patients treated with lifestyle only (n = 28), vitamin D supplementation reduced HbA1c compared with placebo (-0.1% vs 0.3%, respectively; P = 0.034) at week 24. This result was not observed at the other time points and could be due to chance. Vitamin D3 at 4000 IU/d did not change ISR or HbA1c in patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes on metformin not selected for vitamin D deficiency.\n",
